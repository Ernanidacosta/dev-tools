## LINUX

First, I like to create partitions manually, this help me format my computer and make it ready to code in few minutes.

```bash
Partitions to my 256GB SSD Hard drive:

/dev/sda1        75 GB  /           ---> SO (I can change any time)
/dev/sda2         8 GB  swap
/dev/sda3       170 GB  /home       ---> My files, keys and settings
/dev/sda4         1 GB  /boot/efi
/dev/sda5       1,5 GB  /boot
```
